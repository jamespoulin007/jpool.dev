# a summary about you
summary: "I specialize in making complex tech challenges disappear – and building high-performing teams to do the same. With 15 years of experience, I've had a hand in everything from writing Infrastructure-as-Code to deploy and manage infrstructure that supports hundreds of environments globally (because apparently, I enjoy time zones). My experience includes not only the technical deep dives like deploying k8s applications, building out a 100 Gigabit fibre network, managing VMware clusters, wrangling fibre channel storage, and orchestrating performance tests that generate millions of system interactions, but also the human element – I'm good at talent management, from hiring, developing skills within a team, and managing teams across global locations. I'm passionate about building robust and scalable solutions, and I bring that passion to every project, where I focus on designing and implementing cloud infrastructure that delivers results. (And yes, I still remember how to rack a server, though I prefer my infrastructure to be a bit more...cloud-like these days)."
